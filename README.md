# ChessFX ♟️

ChessFX is a simple chess game built in Java using JavaFX. This was the first project I made, and I created it just for fun. Since I didn't seriously playtest it, there might be bugs—so if you find any, please let me know!

(Features like en passant, promotion, castling, check/checkmate detection.)
